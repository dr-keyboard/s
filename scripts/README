# These scripts were created to help in managing this revision control system

# This backup system, paired with a revision control system, should work out
# pretty nicely (although the revision control may not like the symlinks


1. To perform a backup:
   ./new_rev.sh

2. To manually change which folder vim_current points at
   ./chg_vim_sym.sh new_folder_name

3. To perform a backup on a new system:
   ./bak_sym.sh
   #note, it will copy things by default, issuing a warning about it

4. To delete the existing symlinks pointing into ~/s/vim/vim_current:
   ./del_sym.sh
   #might be useful when trying out someone elses stuff

5. To restore symlinks to ~/s/vim/vim_current
   ./res_sym.sh

Typically the following tasks occur:

1. Performing a Backup
   see 1 above

2. Changing the vim folder
   see 2 above

3. Verifying that symlinked files are in use
   ./bak_sym.sh && ./del_sym.sh && ./res_sym.sh


#This concludes the scripting
#Goodbye.
